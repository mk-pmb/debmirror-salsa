Refactoring `cleanup_unknown_files`
===================================

__Bug:__
Original DM ignores `--ignore=` when using the state cache.

__Solution:__
Merge the duplicate deletion code in `sub cleanup_unknown_files`
and have the `--ignore=` checked in both cases.

__Obstacle:__
It's hard to decipher whether the conditions for deletion are actually
the same. We need to decipher them.


### Ok let's go!

My approach to de-duping the deletion code is to move it into a new sub
and call that sub from both places. Let's call that new sub
`maybe_cleanup_one_file` until someone comes up with a better name.

It will be structured to first check all reasons why the file should NOT
be deleted, and if any matches, flinch.

### Step 1: Simplify the old non-deletion criteria.
