Support `dists`-less repos
==========================

Some apt repos do not have a `dists` folder, e.g.
[waterfox](https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/hawkeye116477:/waterfox/xUbuntu_20.04/).

My dirty hack attempt with `--dist=..` fails with:

```text
State cache file does not exist; doing full mirroring.
Getting meta files ...
[  0%] Getting: dists/../Release... ok
[  0%] Getting: dists/../Release.gpg... ok
Use of uninitialized value $suite in string ne at /var/www/…/debmirror line 2392.
Broken Release file: neither Codename nor Suite matches ...
```

At the time, line 2392 was

```perl
  } elsif ($codename) {
    if ($dist_raw ne $codename && $dist_raw ne $suite) {
```

in `sub name_release`.


Work-around
-----------

This patch introduces a work-around that allows users to inject
custom URL rewriting code into `sub name_release` via
environment variable `DM_EVAL_HTTPGET_MODIFY_URL`.

Example for waterfox:

```bash
export DM_EVAL_HTTPGET_MODIFY_URL='
  s~(/waterfox/[\w\.]+/)(dists/[\w\.]+/(main/binary-amd64/|)|)~$1~;'
```

Depending on your setup, you may need additional symlinks in your webspace
for the `all` and `amd64` directories, as well as for the
`Packages*` and `Release*` files.



Support for data: URIs
----------------------

Since we can deal with `Packages.gz` being an empty text file,
using a data: URI to supply an empty text file allows an easy fix
for the WineHQ trusty/xenial/bionic repos:

```bash
export DM_EVAL_HTTPGET_MODIFY_URL='
  s~^(.*)(dists/\w+/main/binary-all/Packages\.gz)$~data:text/plain,~;'
```


### The seemingly unused `use URI;`

That `use URI;` is meant as a pointer for people wondering why I added
`liburi-perl` to the dependencies.
LWP automatically understands data: URIs as long as the URI module
is available and provides `URI::data`.

The exercise of figuring out which minimum version of the URI module does
that, can safely be left to users who actually need this feature.
Ubuntu trusty had it by default, so for most people it will probably
just work out of the box.
