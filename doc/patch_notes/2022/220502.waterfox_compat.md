Support `dists`-less repos
==========================

Some apt repos do not have a `dists` folder, e.g.
[waterfox](https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/hawkeye116477:/waterfox/xUbuntu_20.04/).

My dirty hack attempt with `--dist=..` fails with:

```text
State cache file does not exist; doing full mirroring.
Getting meta files ...
[  0%] Getting: dists/../Release... ok
[  0%] Getting: dists/../Release.gpg... ok
Use of uninitialized value $suite in string ne at /var/www/…/debmirror line 2392.
Broken Release file: neither Codename nor Suite matches ...
```

At the time, line 2392 was

```perl
  } elsif ($codename) {
    if ($dist_raw ne $codename && $dist_raw ne $suite) {
```

in `sub name_release`.


Work-around
-----------

This patch introduces a work-around that allows users to inject
custom URL rewriting code into `sub name_release` via
environment variable `DM_EVAL_HTTPGET_MODIFY_URL`.

Example for waterfox:

```bash
export DM_EVAL_HTTPGET_MODIFY_URL='
  s~(/waterfox/[\w\.]+/)(dists/[\w\.]+/(main/binary-amd64/|)|)~$1~;'
```

Depending on your setup, you may need additional symlinks in your webspace
for the `all` and `amd64` directories, as well as for the
`Packages*` and `Release*` files.
