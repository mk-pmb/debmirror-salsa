Deal with plaintext in Packages.gz
==================================

In late July of 2017, this error started to crop up:

```text
debmirror: gzip: stdin: not in gzip format / Failed: gzip -d <.temp/dists/…
```

This error occurred if some `.gz` files in the source repo are actually
plain text files masquerading as `.gz`.
Obviously, gzip's complaint is correct: Plain text isn't in gzip format.

This came up because the "gogs" repo served un-compressed content,
including [plaintext package lists][gogs-plain-list]
and [empty files][gogs-empty-list].
