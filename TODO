User Interface
==============

* It would probably be cleaner and easier to learn if it took
  apt-style lines to tell where to mirror from and what portions to use.



Security
========

* We should offer an option to check ALL the checksums available,
  rather than just the strongest.
  * Also the algorithm to determine the strongest hash should be refactored
    into something nicer.

* Check for potential shell injections:
  * All `system` calls and all backticks (\`)
  * Some of them use improvised shell quoting rather than proper `shell_quote`
